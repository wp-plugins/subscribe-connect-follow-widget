== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the difference between the 'Feedburner Feed' and 'RSS Feed' options? =

There are two differences. 

1. The 'Feedburner Feed' option displays the Feedburner icon while the 'RSS Feed' option displays the standard RSS icon (as do 'RSS Feed for Posts' and 'RSS Feed for Comments' options).

2. For 'Feedburner Feed' you only need to provide the Feedburner feed name in the widget options and the URL for the link will be automatically generated, whereas for 'RSS Feed' you need to provide the full URL. 

The general 'RSS Feed' option (or 'RSS Feed for Posts' / 'RSS Feed for Comments', as applicable) can be used for a Feedburner feed when the standard RSS icon is preferred over the Feedburner icon.

= The number of items that can be added is 5 by default. How to add more items? =

Simply change the value of the 'Number of items' field in the widget options, for example, to 7, and *Save* your options. After saving you will find that you will have two more fields added and the total number of items you can now add is 7.
